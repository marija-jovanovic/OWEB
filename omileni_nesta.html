<fieldset><legend><h2>General</h2></legend>
<p class = "tekst">Music plays an essential role in everyday life. It calms us down, puts us in a better mood and overall it makes life more enjoyable. We can think of music as a spice that we occasionally add to our lives to enhance the moment, just like we use spices to enhance the flavour of food.<br><br>

Personally speaking, my favourite music genre is <strong>Jazz</strong>, specifically <strong>Smooth Jazz</strong>. Smooth Jazz is a jazz subgenre which is a mix of commercially-oriented crossover jazz and easy listening music that became dominant in the mid 1970s to the early 1990s. The perfect blend of piano and saxophone produces a magical melody that is like an ear candy. No matter what I am doing, whether that means studying or simply relaxing, smooth jazz is the way to go.<br><br>
If you would like to try out smooth jazz, I would highly recommend visiting the <a href = "https://www.smoothjazz.com/#"><strong>smooth jazz radio</strong></a> or by clicking on the image on the right. <a href = "https://www.smoothjazz.com/#">

<fieldset><legend><h2>Favourite Artist</h2></legend>
<p class = "tekst">
My favourite jazz artist is <strong>Amaro Freitas</strong>. He is a Brazillian jazz pianist and composer whose sound is rooted in the folk and ceremonial rhythms and harmonies from his country's northern region. His 2016 debut, Sangue Negro, showcased a percussive approach to the instrument that prizes the Afro-Brazilian maracatu rhythm, the high-intensity carnival rhythms of frevo and baião, the bop innovations of Charlie Parker and Thelonious Monk, and the post-bop and modal sounds of John Coltrane. 2018's Rasif employed baiao and a particularly Brazilian strain of post-bop that swung so hard it sounded like dance music. 2021's Sankofa showcased a yet more expansive aspect of his compositional style as he revisioned Brazil's historic folk styles and rhythms through the refracted lens of modern jazz. For more information check out his fully detailed <a href = "https://www.allmusic.com/artist/amaro-freitas-mn0003774167/biography"><strong> biography.</strong></a><br><br>
In October 2022, Freitas and his Trio visited Macedonia and performed at the <strong>Skopje Jazz Festival</strong>. It was a pleasure watching their performance.

<fieldset><legend><h2>General</h2></legend>
<p class = "tekst">
It is a well known fact that everybody enjoys eating delicious food.<br><br>
For me, I equally enjoy preparing food and eating it. Preparing food is just like art. It requires creativity and courage to experiment with different ingredients and spices. Coming up with a perfect dish is not easy and it takes several trials, however the end product is always worth it!<br><br>
My favourite cuisine is definitely the <strong>Mexican</strong> cuisine. It consists of ingredients which are native to the mexican land such as beans, corn, avocados, chili pepper, tomatoes etc. Their food is enriched by various spices and herbs such as coriander, oregano, cumin, mexican cinammon, thyme etc. The end product of a mexican cuisine is a dish full of different flavours, freshness and spiciness. Some of their most popular dishes include burritos, tacos, enchiladas, nachos, guacamole and many more.<br><br>

<fieldset><legend><h2>Burrito Recipe</h2></legend>
<p class = "tekst">
In this section, I will present you my very own simple recipe for making a <strong>mexican burrito</strong>.<br><br>

<strong>Ingredients:</strong><br>
<ul>
<li>Any type of meat (chicken, pork, lamb)</li>
<li>Lettuce</li>
<li>Onion</li>
<li>Yellow cheese</li>
<li>Lime(preferably) or lemon</li>
<li>Mexican spices</li>
<li>Tomato salsa</li>
<li>Tortillas</li>
</ul>
<br><br>
<strong>Preparation:</strong><br>
Chop the meat in thin and small slices and fry it in a pan. Once the meat is fried, pour the tomato salsa in the pan and stir. Let the meat absorb the salsa for a few minutes and add the mexican spices. Stir until everything is well mixed.<br><br>
The next step is to fill the tortillas with the ingredients. Place one tortilla in a plate and put some amount of meat on it. Chop the lettuce and onion in smaller pieces and place them on the tortilla next to the meat. Grate some yellow cheese over the tortilla and finally sprinkle it all over with lime or lemon. Carefully wrap the tortilla and enjoy!<br><br>

<br><br>
<strong>P.S.</strong> The amount of ingredients you will use depend on your taste and preferences. Also you may add beans and corn, however I prefer my burrito without them.

<fieldset><legend><h1><u>Travelling</u></h1></legend>
<p class = "tekst">
Travelling is another passion of mine. Visiting new countries, admiring the beautiful landscape, tasting new dishes and learning about new cultures is priceless. Travelling also helps us broaden our horizons and become more open-minded.<br><br>
Personally, I enjoy visiting countries that have beaches and warm weather. It also happens that locals in such countries are the most welcoming to tourists.<br><br> <strong>Spain</strong> is a perfect example of a country that I admire. Spain is rich in culture and history, breath-taking landscape, awesome food, great weather and a well work-life balance.

<fieldset><legend><h2>Favourite Vacation Spot</h2></legend>
<p class = "tekst">
As you would have already thought, my favourite vacation spot is in Spain. To be precise, it is <strong>Palma de Mallorca</strong>.
<p class = "tekst">
Palma also known as Palma de Mallorca is the capital and largest city of the autonomous community of the Balearic Islands in Spain. It is situated on the south coast of Mallorca on the Bay of Palma. Palma is suitable for people of all age making it a perfect vacation spot for everyone. It has beautiful long and wide beaches and clear water. Palma Airport serves over 29 million passengers per year. This speaks how popular of a destination Palma is!<br><br>

<br>
If you are in Palma, make sure to visit <strong>Sóller</strong>, a small town rich in historical heritage. Taking Sóller's <strong>tramway</strong> service which is a preserved spanish cultural heritage offers you a unique experience to explore the town. The tram also takes you to <strong>Port de Sóller</strong> which is a coastal village. You can take that chance and spend some time on the local beach.<br><br>
<img src = "soller.jpg" alt = "Sóller" class = "klasa">
<br>
Another interesting place to visit in Mallorca is the <strong>pearl factory called Majorica</strong>. Their pearl jewellery is well known and you may directly see all the products they offer as well as the way they make them. You may also purchase their products if you wish.<br><br>
<img src = "majorica.jpg" alt = "Majorica - pearl factory" class = "klasa">
<br>
To sum up, there are many beautiful places worth visiting in Mallorca and taking a <strong>car rental service</strong> will greatly benefit you in visiting as many places as possible.
